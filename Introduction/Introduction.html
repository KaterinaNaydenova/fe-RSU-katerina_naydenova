			<h1>Hello!</h1>
			<p>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;<br>
			   Coral is far more red than her lips' red;<br>
			   If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;<br>
			   If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.<br>
			</p>   
			<p>I have seen roses damasked red and white,<br>
			   But no such roses see I in her cheeks,<br>
			   And in some perfumes is there more delight<br>
			   Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.<br>
			</p>
